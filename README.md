Improved Ancient Heros Aspect Armor

I personally was completely unimpressed by what we were given for all our efforts of getting the shrines done. So, since you have to go everywhere to get it, I figured it should LET you go everywhere, unimpeded. It has, Speed Up 3, Heat Resist 3, Cold Resist 3, No Slip (The frog suit set bonus), and Stealth 3.

I wanted to add Gloom Resistance, No Fall Damage, and all three immunities as well (Flame, Ice, and Lightning), but unfortunately I'm having a very hard time with increasing the Resource Table without getting an infinite load, and I'd need to make one for multiple versions, but I'm okay with that. If anyone can tell me what exactly I'm doing wrong with this process, I'd greatly appreciate it, but otherwise, I hope you enjoy.
